# 100DaysOfCode

### Day 0: March 10, 2020

**Todays progress:**: Completed unfinished freeCodeCamp projects, revised css advanced concepts with flexbox.

**Thoughts:** I started this challenge to keep hooked with frontend stuff. I touched CSS after a long time, really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. But I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
